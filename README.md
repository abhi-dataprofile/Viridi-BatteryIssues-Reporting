# Viridi-BatteryIssues-Reporting

## Objective:
To design and implement an optimized ETL pipeline for Viridi to manage large-scale data ingestion, transformation, and reporting of battery-related issues, ensuring efficient data processing and actionable insights for improved performance and decision-making.

## Project Description:
This project demonstrates my expertise in building ETL pipelines capable of handling large volumes of data related to battery performance and issue reporting. The ETL pipeline ingests raw data from various sources, transforms it into meaningful formats, and loads it into reporting systems for comprehensive analysis and reporting.

The solution focuses on scalability, automation, and high availability using cloud-based infrastructure and distributed processing frameworks.

## ETL Pipeline Architecture:
1. **Data Ingestion:**
   - Raw battery performance data is ingested from IoT devices and logs into Amazon S3.
   - Set up EC2 instances to support data flow orchestration for batch processing.
   - Leveraged AWS Step Functions to automate and orchestrate pipeline steps.

2. **Data Transformation:**
   - Utilized PySpark for distributed data transformations to handle large-scale datasets efficiently.
   - Performed data cleansing, anomaly detection, and normalization of battery performance metrics.
   - Used Hive SQL to manage structured transformations and generate pre-aggregated reports.

3. **Data Storage and Loading:**
   - Optimized data loading into Snowflake for fast querying and analytical reporting.
   - Created partitioned tables and managed query optimization using clustering keys in Snowflake.
   - Leveraged S3 for intermediate data storage and backup.

4. **Automation and Infrastructure Management:**
   - Deployed Terraform to provision and manage infrastructure components.
   - Integrated automated email notifications for data pipeline completion and issue alerts.
   - Configured cron jobs to run periodic ETL processes.

## Key Achievements:
- **Improved Reporting Efficiency:** Reduced reporting time for battery issues by 40% by implementing parallelized ETL processes.
- **Scalability:** The ETL pipeline can handle terabytes of data with minimal downtime.
- **Automation:** End-to-end automation using AWS Step Functions and Terraform, reducing manual intervention and operational costs.
- **Data Integrity:** Implemented checks to validate data quality and detect missing or incorrect records before loading into Snowflake.

## Skills and Technologies Used:
- **Data Processing:** PySpark, Hive SQL  
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** AWS S3, EC2, Snowflake, AWS Step Functions  
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform  
- **Automation:** Cron Jobs, Email Notifications  
- **Version Control:** GitHub ([Repository Link](https://github.com/abhi-dataprofile/Viridi-BatteryIssues-Reporting/tree/main/Viridi-batteryIssues-Reporting))

## Next Steps:
1. **Integration of Real-Time Processing:** Add real-time streaming components using Apache Kafka to handle live data streams.
2. **Dashboard Creation:** Build interactive dashboards using BI tools like Tableau or AWS Quicksight for battery performance monitoring.
